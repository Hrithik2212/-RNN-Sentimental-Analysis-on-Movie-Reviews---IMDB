## Aim 
* To develop a model that predicts wether a given movie review is positive or negative 
---

#### 0_Mining_Data.ipynb 
* This file cotains the process of extracting the data from 50000 text files in two seperate directories of train and test
* A custom function is created for this and the dataset is created 

#### 1_Exploration&Preparation.ipynb 

* This file contains certain exploration on the data and certain feature engineering steps were applied 

#### 2_Exploration&Preparation2.ipynb 

* In this file with the help of nltk and word cloud graphs were plot 

#### 3_Model_DL.ipynb 

* A Recurrent Neural Network Model was built with Keras with an Train accuracy of 86% and validation accuracy of 79%
